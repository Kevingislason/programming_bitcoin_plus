# Rust bitcoin hardware wallet demos

Building a Bitcoin hardware wallet in embedded Rust, one small step at a time

Phase 1: create and sign a Bitcoin transaction with the rust_bitcoin library (see sign_bitcoin_transaction.rs)<br/>
Phase 2: create and sign a Bitcoin transaction using only my own code (see main.rs) <br/>
Phase 3: create and sign a Bitcoin transaction in Rust on bare metal, i.e. without the standard library (in progress)
